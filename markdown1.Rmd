## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=16}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Emphasis given to *this* word. Fortune favors the **bold**.

## math

This is inline math $a+b$

$$a+b$$
\( a+b \)

\[ 
a+b.
\]

$\sin(x)$
$\geq$
$\emptyset$

## Code chunks and random

```{r}
sqrt(13)

mean(runif(10))

replicate(100, mean(runif(10)))
```

## functions

```{r}
add <- function(a = 2, b = 4) { s <- a + 2*b
return(s)
}

add(0, 10)

foo<-function(x,y){
  return(x^y)
}
```
